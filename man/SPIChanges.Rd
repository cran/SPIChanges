\arguments{
\item{rain.at.TS}{A 4-column matrix generated with \code{TSaggreg()}. No other objects are accepted.
\itemize{
\item 1st column is years (YYYY),

\details{
The \code{SPIChanges()} function implements a nonstationary parametric approach to detect
changes in precipitation patterns and assess their impact on the expected frequency
of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. It evaluates 16 candidate models
based on time-varying gamma distributions, which account for a broad range of linear
and nonlinear changes in both the mean and dispersion of the precipitation series.

Model selection is performed using the second-order Akaike Information Criterion (AICc),
and the selected model is used to compute the cumulative probability of each
precipitation amount under changing climate conditions. These nonstationary probabilities
are then compared with those from the original, stationary SPI algorithm to identify
whether the frequency of drought events has increased or decreased over time.

For detailed explanations of the gamma-based models and the model selection procedure,
please refer to the README and Vignettes included in the package.
